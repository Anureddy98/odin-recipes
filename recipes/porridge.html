    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        cup rolled oats
        2 Â½ cups water
        1 cup milk of your choice (dairy or non-dairy)
        Pinch of salt, to taste 
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation Method</h3>

        step-1:Combine the ingredients: In a saucepan, combine the rolled oats, water, and a pinch of salt.
        step-2:Bring to a boil: Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
        step-3:Simmer and cook: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until the liquid is absorbed and the oats are cooked through.This will likely take around 10-15 minutes.
        step-4:Add milk and simmer: Stir in the milk and continue to simmer for a few more minutes until the porridge reaches your desired consistency. If you like thicker porridge, you may need less milk, and if you prefer a thinner consistency, you can add a bit more.
