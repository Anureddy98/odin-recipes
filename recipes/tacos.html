        <h3>Directions for cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            Cook meat, onion, garlic and cilantro stirring often til meat is no longer pink. Drain fat.
            Add seasoning and 3/4 cup water or beer to meat mixture and stir to blend. Only use beer if you like beer! lol You could also use half beer and half water. DH always comes in and adds a glug or two from his can behind my back so I never know exactly how much is in there! grrrr.
            Simmer until liquid has evaporated.
            Serve with desired toppings. Get creative! Use what you like!
            This can fill tortillas, corn or flour, or be used to top corn or tortilla chips. When I make this I make a taco salad on my plate, dd makes that or some tacos and dh always makes nachos putting only cheese on top and microwaving til the cheese is melty. To each his own! I get three different meals with one skillet!
